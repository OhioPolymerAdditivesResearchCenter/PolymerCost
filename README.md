# PolymerCost
Tools for polymer formulation and costing.

PolymerCost is available in python, python notebooks, and office spreadsheets.

The main function of PolymerCost is to cost out polymer formulations.

You can enter any polymer formulation and it will calculate out the cost per pound and more importantly both the specific gravity and cost per volume of that formula.

The most important lesson in the plastics industry is this.  When making parts, you generally buy plastic by the pound, but you sell it by the volume.  

This is important because you can control your final part weight by modifying the formula to adjust the specific gravity of the formula as well as the cost.

This software allows you to do this with any and all formulas and do it in code.  

Before going to the lab or production, you can write formulas in code and simulate them in silicon before committing materials, machine, and men to the task.

With additional data you can do compound mechanical properties prediction.  The PVC industry has the best data published on this topic as the most compounded of the plastics, so I have included the basics of flexible PVC compounding here too.

Additional tools are available as well.

I have specific tools for ExxonMobil's Vistamaxx line, Struktol's polypropylene vis-breakers in code, and more.

If you have data, I would love to turn it into to useful code.  If you have code from that data, that would be welcomed too.

Any questions or comments just let us know.
